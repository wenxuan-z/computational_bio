## Question 1:

##### Load the package nycflights13 with library(nycflights13). If you are not on the servers, you will need to install this package before you can use it! 

##### Run the included code chunk below to save flights and airports to your environment.

```{R}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

flights<-flights
airports<-airports
airlines<-airlines
```

##### Explore the `flights` dataset (e.g., run `glimpse(flights)` read the description of each variable in the help by running `?flights`). Notice how many rows/observations there are: That's how many flights left the three big NYC airports in 2013!

### 1.1 (2 pts) 

##### Report the number and proportion of NAs for each variable using summarize_all() and/or mutate_all(). Ideally, you will write your own short function(s) to count NAs and apply it to every column via `summarize_all`, but there are other ways.

```{R}
numNA <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))
proNA <- function(x) mean(is.na(x))
flights %>% summarise_all(numNA)
flights %>% summarise_all(proNA)
```


### 1.2 (2 pts) 

##### Remove all rows containing NAs from the dataset (**for the rest of the assignment, we will be using only the complete rows, so overwrite the `flights` dataset or save it as a new object and use it in place of `flights` from here on out**). Now, using filter, what airport `dest`ination (three-letter code fine) has the longest `air_time`? 

```{R}
flights <- flights %>% na.omit()
flights %>% filter(air_time==max(air_time)) %>% select(dest)
```
*HNL has the longest air_time. *

### 1.3 (4 pts) 

##### Find the mean, standard deviation, count, and standard error of `distance` in each month (i.e., averaged across `day`) for flights from the three different New York airports (`origin`). You will use your sd and count to find your se=sd/sqrt(count). Rename your summary variables inside of `summarize()`. 

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>%  
  summarise(mean=mean(distance),sd=sd(distance),count=n(),se=sd/sqrt(count))
```

### 1.4 (4 pts) 

##### Using your results from part 1.3, make a barplot of mean distance for each month using `ggplot()`. Add manual standard error bars using geom_errorbar() by specifying `aes(x=month, y=your_mean, ymin=your_mean-your_se, ymax=your_mean+your_se)`. Facet (or equivalent) by `origin` and provide labels/ticks on the x-axis for each month. Write a bit about what you see!

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>%  
  summarise(mean=mean(distance),sd=sd(distance),count=n(),se=sd/sqrt(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, mean)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + facet_wrap(~ origin) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = month, y = mean, ymin = mean-se, ymax = mean+se)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```


*For flights with origin of LGA, the mean distance is the lowest compared with flights with the other 2 origins. For flights from EWR and JFK, the mean distance generally increases as time goes by, but for flights from LGA, the mean distance does not fluctuate much during the year. *

## Question 2 (2 pts)

Let's do some joining! The dataset `airlines` contains the full name of the carrier (examine it!). Join the dataset with the flights dataset so all of the information in `flights` is retained. Using the merged dataset, which carrier (`name`) has the longest average departure delay? Which has the shortest?

```{R}
merged <- flights %>% left_join(airlines, by='carrier')
merged %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(mean_dep_delay=mean(dep_delay)) %>% arrange(mean_dep_delay)
```


*Frontier Airlines has the longest average departure delay, and US Airways has the shortest average departure delay. *


## Question 3 


### 3.1 (4 pts) 

##### Look at the dataset called `airports`. How many rows does it have? How many unique airports (variable `faa`)? Using methods we have seen/discussed (e.g., `%in%` with `sum()` or `mean()`, set operations, joins), how many of these airports (variable `faa`) appear in the `flights` dataset as destinations (variable `dest`)? How many unique destination airports are there in the flights dataset? Which destination airports are in the `flights` dataset but missing from the `airports` dataset? Google those airport codes: what do they have in common?

```{R}
#your code here anti_join()
glimpse(airports)
airports %>% summarize(n_distinct(faa))
flights %>% inner_join(airports, by=c('dest'='faa')) %>% summarize(n_distinct(dest))
flights %>% summarise(n_distinct(dest))
flights %>% anti_join(airports, by=c('dest'='faa')) %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarize(mean(dep_delay))
```

*The dataset `airports` has 1458 rows and 1458 unique airports. 100 airports in the `airports` dataset appear in the `flight` dataset as destinations. There are 104 unique destination airports in the `flight` dataset. BQN, PSE, SJU, and STT are in the `flights` dataset but missing from the `airports` dataset. They are in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, isolated from the US. *

### 3.2 (2 pts) 

##### Do a join that results in a dataset that contains only the rows with matches (i.e., none of the airports not appearing in `flights`, none of the destinations not appearing in `airports`). Call `glimpse()` on this final dataset (please don't print the whole thing out).

```{R}
glimpse(flights %>% inner_join(airports, by=c('dest'='faa')))
```
