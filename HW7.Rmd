## Question 1.1 (3 pts)

- Run the following code to generate some play data (variables x and y). Then, regress y on x with `lm(y~x)` and call summary() on the fitted model. Make a scatterplot (either base R or ggplot) to eyeball whether homoskedasticity is met (i.e., do the points fan out as you go up the x-axis?). Then run the Breuch-Pagan test `bptest()` to formally test this null hypothesis. If you reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity, redo the regression using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. How does this change your t-statistics and p-values?

You will need the `lmtest` package and the `sandwich` package in order to do things like `bptest(fit)` and `coeftest(fit,vcov=vcovHC(fit))`; install them if you haven't.

```{R}
set.seed(348)
x <- runif(55, 0, 1)
y <- .1 * rnorm(55, x, x)
fit1 <- lm(y~x)
summary(fit1)
plot(x,y)
library(sandwich); library(lmtest)
bptest(fit1)
coeftest(fit1, vcov = vcovHC(fit1))
```
*Homoskedasticity is met. I reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors increase the t-statistics for the intercept and p-value for x, and decrease the t-statistics for x and p-value for the intercept. *

## Question 1.2 (3 pts)

- Run the following code to generate more play data (new variables x and y). Then, regress y on x with `lm(y~x) and call summary. Make a scatterplot (either base R or ggplot) to eyeball whether homoskedasticity is met. Then, use the Breuch-Pagan test `bptest()` to formally test this null hypothesis. Regardless of the result, redo the regression using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors. How does this change your t-statistics and p-values? How does this change differ from before (both in direction and magnitude)?

```{R}
set.seed(348)
x <- runif(55, 0, 1)
y <- .1 * rnorm(55, x, .6)
fit2 <- lm(y~x)
summary(fit2)
plot(x,y)
bptest(fit2)
coeftest(fit2, vcov = vcovHC(fit2))
```
*Homoskedasticity is not met. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors decrease the t-statistics for the intercept and p-value for x, and increase the t-statistics for x and p-value for the intercept. The direction is the reverse of the previous question, and the magnitude is smaller. *

## Question 1.3 (3 pts)

Using `x` and `y` from 1.2, calculate the bootstrap standard error of the slope by resampling observations (i.e., rows) from your dataframe with replacement. Also, calculate the boostrap standard error of the slope by resampling residuals (from the model fit in 1.2, with replacement), adding them to the fitted values to get the new "data", re-computing the regression coefficient, saving, and repeating. For each, use 5000 iterations. How do your results compare with the standard errors from question 1.2? Would you still reject the null hypothesis using these standard errors?

```{R}
set.seed(348)
data1 <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)

samp_distn<-replicate(5000, {
  boot_dat <- sample_frac(data1, replace=TRUE)
  fit <- lm(y~x, data=boot_dat)
  coef(fit)
}) 
samp_distn %>% t %>% as.data.frame %>% summarize_all(sd)

fit<-lm(y~x,data=data1)
resids<-fit$residuals #save residuals
fitted<-fit$fitted.values
resid_resamp<-replicate(5000,{
  new_resids<-sample(resids,replace=TRUE)
  data1$new_y<-fitted+new_resids
  fit<-lm(new_y~x,data=data1)
  coef(fit)
})
resid_resamp%>%t%>%as.data.frame%>%summarize_all(sd)
```

**The results from resampling observations and the results from resampling residuals are similar to the standard errors from question 1.2, so I would still reject the null hypothesis. **


## Question 2.1 (3 pts)

Using the `msleep` data (in ggplot2), regress `sleep_rem` on the interaction of `brainwt` and `vore`. Interpret the intercept in context. Interpret the coefficient `brainwt` in context. Interpret the coefficient for `voreinsecti` in context. Interpret the coefficient for `brainwt:voreinsecti` in context (Ignore significance, etc.)

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
fit3 <- lm(sleep_rem~brainwt*vore, data=msleep)
summary(fit3)
```

**Predicted rem sleep for carnivores with zero brain weight is 2.685. For every 1-unit increase in brain weight, predicted rem sleep goes down 3.426 hours for this group. Insectivores with zero brain weight have predicted rem sleep that is 0.041 less than carnivores with zero brain weight. Slope of brain weight on rem sleep for insectivores is 46.017 greater than for carnivores. **

## Question 2.2 (2 pts)

Rerun the same regression as above, but center the `brainwt` variable first by subtracting the mean (use na.rm=T). Which coefficients that you interpreted in 2a (above) changed? Why? Reinterpret any coefficient from part 2.1 that changed. (Ignore significance, etc.)  

```{R}
msleep$brainwt_c <- msleep$brainwt - mean(msleep$brainwt, na.rm = T)
fit4 <- lm(sleep_rem~brainwt_c*vore, data=msleep)
summary(fit4)
```

**Intercept and voreinsecti changed because they are measured at mean brain weight. Predicted rem sleep for carnivores with average brain weight is 1.72. Insectivores with average brain weight have predicted rem sleep that is 12.9163 more than carnivores with average brain weight. **

## Question 2.3 (2 pts)

Remove NA from `vore` only (i.e., use filter rather than na.omit) and make a plot of `rem_sleep` by `brainwt` colored/grouped by vore, using `geom_smooth(method="lm")` to visualize this regression. What is the mean value of brainwt? Using the plot, Does it make sense to extrapolate to this value for the `voreinsecti` coefficient (think about your interpretation of this coefficient in 2.2)?

```{R}
msleep1 <- msleep %>% filter(vore != 'NA')
ggplot(msleep1,aes(brainwt, sleep_rem, color=vore))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  xlim(0,1.4)+geom_vline(xintercept = mean(msleep1$brainwt, na.rm = T), linetype='dashed')
mean(msleep$brainwt, na.rm = T)
```

**The mean value of brain weight is 0.282. It does not make sense to extrapolate to this value for the `voreinsecti` coefficient. **

## Question 2.4 (2 pts)

Regression makes no assumptions about the distribution of the predictors, and taking the log will fix the issue observed in 2.3. Take the natural log of brainwt, then center it (don't forget `na.rm=T`), and then rerun the regression model with this brainwt variable instead (note that you can't just take the log of the centered variable). Use heteroskedasticity robust standard errors `coeftest(fit, vcov=vcovHC(fit))`. Interpret the one significant effect and, finally, discuss significance and your decision with respect to the null hypothesis

```{R}
msleep$brainwt_log <- log(msleep$brainwt)
msleep$brainwt_log_c <- msleep$brainwt_log - mean(msleep$brainwt_log, na.rm = T)
fit5 <- lm(sleep_rem~brainwt_log_c*vore, data=msleep)
summary(fit5)
coeftest(fit5, vcov=vcovHC(fit5))
```

**Rem sleep in the herbivores is 1.409 hours less than in the carnivores at average log brain weight. I reject the null hypothesis that herbivores have the same mean rem sleep as the carnivores. **

## Question 2.5 (2 pts)

Make a new plot just like 2.3 (remove NAs from `vore` manually), but this time use the log of `brainwt` on the x-axis and include `geom_smooth(method="lm")` to visualize the regression from 2.4. Where can you see the significant effect on the plot (describe in words)?

```{r}
msleep2 <- msleep %>% filter(vore != 'NA')
ggplot(msleep2,aes(brainwt_log, sleep_rem, color=vore))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+geom_vline(xintercept = mean(msleep2$brainwt_log, na.rm = T), linetype='dashed')
```


**Rem sleep in the herbivores is less than in the carnivores at average log brain weight and their slope are kind of parallel. **
