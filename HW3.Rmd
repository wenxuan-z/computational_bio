### Question 1:

##### 1.1 (1 pt) Assume diastolic blood pressure is normally distributed in a certain population, with a mean of 68 mmHg and a standard deviation 14 mmHg. What proportion of this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg (i.e., what is the probability that a person in this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60)?

```{R}
pnorm(60, mean = 68, sd = 14)
```

*28.39% of this population has a diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg.*

##### 1.2 (1 pt) What diastolic blood pressure would put an individual from this population at the 95th percentile?

```{R}
qnorm(0.95, mean = 68, sd = 14)
```

*An individual with a diastolic blood pressure of 91.03 mmHg would be at the 95th percentile.*

##### 1.3 (1 pt) What is the probability that a random individual from this population will have a diastolic blood pressure higher than 80? (Equivalently, what proportion of the population has a diastolic BP greater than 80 mmHg?)

```{R}
1 - pnorm(80, mean = 68, sd = 14)
```

*The probability that a random individual from this population will have a diastolic blood pressure higher than 80 mmHg is 0.1957.*


##### 1.4 (1 pt) What proportion of the population has a diastolic blood pressure bewteen 65 and 75?

```{R}
pnorm(75, mean = 68, sd = 14) - pnorm(65, mean = 68, sd = 14)
```

*27.63% of the population has a diastolic blood pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg.*

##### 1.5 (1 pt) Assume this distribution of diastolic blood pressure is for a healthy population. Say we observe someone (from an unknown population) with a diastolic BP of 88 mmHg. What's the probability of observing someone with a diastolic BP this extreme (*in either direction of the mean*) in the healthy population (normal, mean of 68, standard deviation of 14). Think back to two-tailed tests from Biostats or the equivalent.

```{R}
(1 - pnorm(88, mean = 68, sd = 14)) * 2
```

*The probability of observing someone with a diastolic blood pressure this extreme in the healthy population is 0.1531.*


### Question 2

Now, set the seed to 348 with `set.seed()`. Then, with `rnorm` take a sample of size 10000 (ten thousand) from a normal distribution with a mean of 68 and a standard deviation of 14.

##### 2.1 (3 pts) Using mean() on a logical vector, what proportion of the total draws are less than 60? What proportion are greater than 80? What value in your sample represents the 95th percentile?


```{R}
set.seed(348)
samp <- rnorm(10000, mean = 68, sd = 14)

lessthan60 <- samp < 60
mean(lessthan60)
greaterthan80 <- samp > 80
mean(greaterthan80)
quantile(samp, 0.95)
```

*29.73% of the total draws are less than 60; 19.25% of the total draws are greater than 80. 91.14 represents the 95th percentile.*

##### 2.2 (2 pts) What proportion of your sample is between 65 and 75? What proportion is less than 48 *and* greater than 88?

```{R}
between65and75 <- samp > 65 & samp < 75
mean(between65and75)
lessThan48andGreaterThan88 <- samp < 48 | samp > 88
mean(lessThan48andGreaterThan88)
```

*26.7% of the sample is between 65 and 75. 16.07% of the sample is less than 48 or greater than 88.*

##### 2.3 (1 pts) Why are your answers to question 2 close to those in question 1? Why are they not exactly the same?

*The sample size is very big so it can simulate the normal distribution well. For question 1, the mathematical model is used to generate the answers, while for question 2, a simulation of that model is used, and they are not the same because the simulation is random and not continuous.*


##### 2.4 (4 pts) Make your sample from question 2 into a dataframe and, using ggplot2, make a histogram of the sample by mapping the sample to the x-axis in the main `ggplot()` function and then adding `geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..))`. Then, overlay an density plot with `geom_density()`. Using `geom_vline(xintercept=)`, add solid vertical lines corresponding to the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the sample (i.e., using `quantile`). Next overlay a normal distribution with a mean of 68 and a standard deviation of 14 using `geom_line()` with `dnorm()` and `stat="function"`. Make it a different color to differentiate it from the empirical/sample density. Finally, using `geom_vline(xintercept=)`, add dashed vertical lines of the same new color corresponding to the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the actual normal distribution (the healthy population; i.e., using `qnorm`).

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(samp) #makes your sample a column of a dataframe called df
ggplot(df, aes(samp)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(samp, c(0.025, 0.975))) + 
  geom_line(stat="function", fun = dnorm, args = c(68,14), color = 'red') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(qnorm(0.025, 68, 14), qnorm(0.975, 68, 14)), color = 'red', linetype="dashed")
```

### Question 3

##### 3.1 (2 pt) Using `dplyr` functions (filter, summarize; do not use any [] or $) and the `quakes` dataset, What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth?

```{R}
library(dplyr)
quakes %>% filter(depth > median(depth)) %>% summarise(mean(mag))
```

##### 3.2 (1 pt) Using `dplyr` and the `quakes` dataset, create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives `depth` in meters rather than kilometers. Use `mutate()` *only once* to achieve this! Do not use any [] or $.

```{R}
quakes <- quakes %>% mutate(depth_m = depth * 1000)
head(quakes)
```

##### 3.3 (1 pt) Finally, using ggplot, take the quakes dataset and make a scatterplot of `long` (x-axis) and `lat` (y-axis) and color the points by `depth`. Add `coord_map()` to scale axes with mercator projection (if this doesn't work, use coord_fixed to make x- and y-axis scales the same). Optionally, add the extra code below to overlay world map data for this region using the code provided below.

```{R}
library(maps) #install.packages("maps") if not on the servers
world <- map_data("world")

ggplot(quakes) + geom_point(aes(long,lat,color=depth)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group=group), data = world, fill = "red") + xlim(150,200)+ylim(-50,0) + 
  coord_map()

#if you want to overlay a map, uncomment/add the following code to your plot:
#+geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group=group), data = world, fill = "red") + xlim(150,200)+ylim(-50,0)
```
