### Question 1: (2 pts)

##### The dataset `ChickWeight` contains information about the weights (in grams) of chicks on different diets over time (at 2-day intervals).

```{R}
ChickWeight <- as.data.frame(ChickWeight)
head(ChickWeight,10)
```

##### How many distinct chicks are there? How many distinct time points? How many distinct diet conditions? How many chicks per diet condition at the start of the experiment (i.e., at Time 0)? For example, you could use some combination of `table()` and `length()` to answer these questions. *Do not forget to include the code you used to answer these questions!*

```{R}
length(ChickWeight$Chick[ChickWeight$Time == '0'])
length(ChickWeight$Time[ChickWeight$Chick == '1'])
table(ChickWeight$Diet[ChickWeight$Time == '0'])
```

*There are 50 distinct chicks, 12 distinct time points, 4 distinct diet conditions. At the start of the experiment, there are 20 chicks in diet condition 1, and diet condition 2, 3, and 4 have 10 chicks each.*

---

### Question 2.1: (2 pts)

##### Using the ggplot2 package, create a simple scatterplot showing chick `weight` (y-axis) as a function of `Time`. This time, relabel the axes more informatively and give the plot a title.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight))+ 
geom_point()+ ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)')
```


### Question 2.2: (3 pts)

##### Building upon the previous plot, map `Chick` to an aesthetic that assigns a color to each chick's data points. Add lines that connect each chick's points together. Finally, remove the legend.

```{R}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, color = Chick))+ 
geom_point()+ ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)') + 
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick)) + theme(legend.position = 'none')
```


### Question 2.3: (2 pts)

##### Take the plot you made in Question 3 and remove the color from the points only (leave the lines colored by chick, but make all of the points white). Put the points *on top of* the lines.

```{R}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) + 
  ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)') + 
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick, color = Chick)) + theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  geom_point(color = 'white')
```

### Question 2.4: (2 pts)

##### Now, facet by diet. Is it clearer from this plot which diet is the best? (No real right answer: Just show me you are thinking about it.)

```{R}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) + 
  ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)') + 
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick, color = Chick)) + theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  geom_point(color = 'white') + facet_wrap(~Diet)
```

*I think it is not very clear which diet is the best, but in my opinion, diet 3 seems to be the best diet because most of the chicks weigh 200 grams after 20 days, and some of them weigh more than 300 grams, which is very rare for other diet groups. *


### Question 2.5: (2 pts)

##### Go back to your plot from question 2.1 and fit a *linear regression line* (not the default *loess*) to the chicks in each diet with `geom_smooth(...)`. There should be 4 separate straight lines, one for each diet, each a separate color. Now can you see more clearly which diet results in greater weight? Does the effect of diet on weight appear to depend on time?

```{R}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight))+ 
geom_point()+ ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)') +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, aes(color = Diet))
```

*Diet 3 results in greater weight. The effect of diet on weight depends on time. *

### Question 3.1: (2 pts)

##### A scatterplot might not be the best way to visualize this data: It calls attention to the relationship between weight and time, but it can be hard to see the differences between diets. A more traditional approach for achieving this list desideratum would be to a barplot of group means with standard error bars showing +/- 1 standard error.

##### Create a plot using `geom_bar` where each bar's height corresponds to the average chick weight for each of the four diet conditions. Rename the y-axis to include units (e.g., with scale_y_continuous(`name=`...), with ylab(...), with labs(...)) and make the major tick marks go from 0 to 150 by 25 (with `breaks=`).


```{R}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet))+
  geom_bar(aes(y = weight), stat="summary", fun=mean) + ylab('Weight (grams)') +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 150, by = 25))
```


### 3.2 (3 pts)

##### Add error bars showing $\pm 1\ SE$ using `geom_errorbar(stat="summary")`. Make the error-bars skinnier by adding a `width=` argument. Color the bars (not the error bars, but the bar chart bars) by diet and change from the default color scheme using a `scale_fill_` or a `scale_color_` 

```{R}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet, y = weight, fill = Diet))+
  geom_bar(stat="summary", fun=mean) + ylab('Weight (grams)') +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 150, by = 25)) + geom_errorbar(stat="summary", width = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer()
```

### 3.3 (2 pts)

##### Take your code from 3.2 and replace geom_bar() with geom_point. Remove the `breaks=` argument from `scale_y_continuous`. Make the points larger and color them all red. Put them *on top of* the error bars.

```{R}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet, y = weight, fill = Diet)) + 
  ylab('Weight (grams)') + geom_errorbar(stat="summary", width = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer() + geom_point(stat="summary", fun=mean, size = 4, color = 'red')
```


### Bonus question (1 pt)

##### Go back to your plot from question 2.1. Color the points by diet. Now, find a way (e.g., using `stat=summary` and `fun.y=mean`) to plot the mean chick weight at each time point, colored and grouped by diet (I would use either `geom_point` with a different shape/size than the rest of the points or, even better, `geom_step"`, but there are lots of other ways). Then, plot the *overall* mean chick weight at each time point (i.e., not by diet) on top, again using `stat_summary()` (make it a different color, size, or shape than the rest of the points).

##### Note I won't be giving any hints here (it is purely for bonus)!

```{R}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) + geom_point(aes(color = Diet)) + 
  ggtitle('Weight vs. Time') + ylab('Weight (grams)') + xlab('Time (days)') +
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun = mean, aes(shape = Diet, color = Diet), size = 4) +
  geom_point(stat = 'summary', fun = mean, color = 'black', size = 3)
```
