## Q1 (1 pts)

##### The dataset `quakes` contains information about earthquakes occurring near Fiji since 1964. The first few observations are listed below. 

```{R}
head(quakes)
```

##### How many observations are there of each variable (i.e., how many rows are there; show using code)? How many variables are there total (i.e., how many columns are in the dataset)? You can read more about the dataset [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/quakes.html) *Do not forget to include the code you used to find the answer each question*

```{R}
dim(quakes)
```

*There are 1000 observations of each variable. There are 5 variables in total.*

## Q2 (2 pts)

##### What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variables `mag` and `depth`? Note that there are many functions that can be used to answer this question. If you chose to work with each variable separately, recall that you can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `$` operator (e.g., `dataset$variable`). Describe your answer in words.

```{R}
min(quakes$mag)
max(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$mag)
median(quakes$mag)
min(quakes$depth)
max(quakes$depth)
mean(quakes$depth)
median(quakes$depth)
```

*For the variable `mag`, the minimum value is 4, the maximum value is 6.4, the mean value is 4.6204, and the median value is 4.6. For the variable `depth`, the minimum value is 40, the maximum value is 680, the mean value is 311.371, and the median value is 247. *

## Q3

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. The two ways produce equivalent results.

```{R}
median(quakes$mag[quakes$long>175])

median(quakes[quakes$long>175,]$mag) #this is the more conventional notation
```

### 3.1 (1 pt) 
##### Explain what each of the two lines of code are doing in words. Specifically, why do we need to use the comma in the second case but not in the first? Remember that the `$` selects a single variable and that `[ ]` are used for indexing whatever object came before (either a single variable or a dataframe).

*The first line of code uses `$` to select the variable `mag` and `long`, and adds the condition of `long` being greater than 175, so the median of `mag` in obervations with `long` greater than 175 is obtained. The second line of code, the comma is needed because it is subsetting by rows instead of columns. *


### 3.2 (3 pts) 
##### What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's depth and its magnitude?

```{R}
mean(quakes[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth),]$mag)
mean(quakes[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth),]$mag)
```

*When `depth` is greater than the median depth, the mean of `mag` is 4.5232; when `depth` is less than the median depth, the mean of `mag` is 4.7176. This suggests that an earthquake's depth has an inverse relationship with its magnitude. *

### 3.3 (2 pts) 
##### What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's latitude and it's depth?

```{R}
sd(quakes[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth),]$lat)
sd(quakes[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth),]$lat)
```

*When `depth` is greater than the median depth, the standard deviation of `lat` is 3.577252; when `depth` is less than the median depth, the standard deviation of `lat` is 6.1501. This suggests that the latitude of earthquakes deeper than the median depth varies less compared to other earthquakes. *

## Q4 (2 pts)

##### The variable `depth` is measured in kilometers. Create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives depth **in meters rather than kilometers** and add it to the dataset `quakes`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates the new variable but fills it with `NA` values. Overwrite the `NA`s below by writing code on the left-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`) that computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{R}
# update the code below by replacing the NA with the correct expression to convert to meters
quakes$depth_m <- quakes$depth * 1000
head(quakes)
```


## Q5

##### Let's make some plots in base R. 

### 5.1 (2 pt) 
##### Create a boxplot of `depth` using the `boxplot()` function. Describe where you see the min, max, and median (which you calculated in question 2) in this plot.

```{R}
boxplot(quakes$depth, ylab = "Depth (km)", main = "Distribution of Earthquake's Depth", 
    col = "light grey")
```

*The min is 40, which is the bottom whisker shown in graph; the max is 680, which is the upper whisker; the median is 247, which is the bolded line in the middle. *

### 5.2 (2 pt) 
##### Create a histogram of `depth` using the `hist()` function. What important information does the histogram provide that the boxplot does not?

```{R}
hist(quakes$depth, xlab = "Depth (km)", main = "Distribution of Earthquake's Depth", 
    right = FALSE, col = "blue")
```

*The histogram shows that this distribution is a bimodal distribution. *

### 5.3 (2 pt) 
##### Create a scatterplot by plotting variables `mag` and `stations` against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that to generate a scatterplot, the `plot()` takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

```{R}
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations, xlab = "Magnitude", 
    ylab = "Stations", main = "Magnitude and Stations of Earthquake",)
```

*The stations increase as magnitude increases. *

### 5.4 (3 pt) 
##### Create scatterplot of the quakes' geographic locations by plotting `long` on the x-axis and `lat` on the y-axis. Using this plot, and the map/link below (note the two trenches), and some of the techniques you practiced above, are deeper quakes more likely to originate east or west of Fiji?

```{R fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(quakes$long, quakes$lat, xlab = "Longitude", 
    ylab = "Latitude", main = "Longitude and Latitude",)

mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long>175])
mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long<175])
```

*Deeper quakes are more likely to originate east of Fiji. *
